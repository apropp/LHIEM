The first six digits of CPSID index the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. CPSID allows users to link a household record across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern, by assigning a unique CPSID value based on a combination of household identifiers. CPSID will only ever appear for a maximum of 8 times, which is the number of times a household may be observed in the CPS survey (as indexed by MIS). In some cases, a household will appear fewer than 8 times due to migration, mortality, non-response, and recording errors.

CPSID may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. Users should note that ASEC oversample households (as indicated by ASECOVERH) will always have a CPSID value of 0.

      <labl>Annual Social and Economic Supplement Household weight</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[ASECWTH is a household-level weight that should be used to generate statistics about households in March Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement data. The CPS uses a complex stratified sampling scheme, and ASECWTH must be used to produce unbiased household-level statistics from the IPUMS-CPS ASEC data. For analyses of non-ASEC data, researchers should use HWTFINL. For individual-level analyses, researchers should use WTFINL,  ASECWT, or EARNWT. 

ASECWTH generally has the same value as WTSUPP for the household head or reference person. Vacant housing units and households that could not be interviewed due to residents' absence or refusal to participate have a value of zero in HWTSUPP; such sampled units were included in the public use CPS data beginning in 1988. 

Estimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.

Two important points should be noted here. First, the lag between when the Census is conducted and when the CPS weights are updated is about 3 years. While the Census data are being processed, the CPS files are made available using the weighting scheme from the US Census prior to the latest Census. Second, once the files are updated, the old weights become obsolete and are replaced in the IPUMS data extract system. Published estimates from the lag years that use the old weights are not always updated. For example, 2010 poverty estimates were released in ASEC using the 2000 population controls. Once the 2010 population controls were made available, IPUMS-CPS replaced the ASEC 2010, 2011, and 2012 weights that are based on the 2000 population control with weights that are based on the 2010 population controls.

IPUMS-CPS makes available only the most up-to-date weights. The old values are available here: Old SPM and Weights Values [URL omitted from DDI.].]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[CPSIDP is an IPUMS-CPS defined variable that uniquely identifies individuals across CPS samples. The first six digits of CPSIDP index the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. CPSIDP allows users to link a respondent appearing with a designated household roster line number (LINENO) across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern, by assigning a unique CPSIDP value to this line number. CPSIDP will only ever appear for a maximum of 8 times, which is the number of times a household may be observed in the CPS survey (as indexed by MISH). In some cases, individuals will appear fewer than 8 times due to migration, mortality, non-response, and recording errors. Extensive documentation about the creation of CPSIDP is available elsewhere [URL omitted from DDI.].

Users should note that it is important to verify CPSIDP linkages with AGE, SEX, and RACE. In some cases CPSIDP will result in erroneous links, which are due to errors in the source data. Cases with the same CPSIDP value may also have inconsistent responses across samples due to errors on the part of the respondent or in recording the response.  Ultimately, it is up to the individual researcher to determine the acceptability of the linkages made using CPSIDP. 

CPSIDP may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. 

To get started using CPSIDP, users may want to sort their data file by CPSIDP and MISH to create a person-time file. 

Users should take care when including the March Basic or ASEC as part of their linking. Respondents who are part of the ASEC oversample (as indicated by ASECOVERP) have a CPSIDP value of 0.  For further information about the relationship between the March Basic and the ASEC, please see our additional documentation [URL omitted from DDI.].]]></txt>

      <labl>Annual Social and Economic Supplement Weight</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[ASECWT is a person-level weight that should be used in analyses of individual-level CPS supplement data. Since the CPS relies on a complex stratified sampling scheme, it is essential to use one of the provided weighting variables.

Researchers should use WTFINL rather than ASECWT when they wish to conduct person-level analyses of non-ASEC data. EARNWT should be used for any analysis including a small number of person-level variables (EARNWEEK, HOURWAGE, PAIDHOUR, and UNION). Researchers should use  ASECWTH for household-level analyses.

User Caution: For analyses that include the 2014 ASEC sample, please see the comparability tab.

The ASEC CPS files include two groups of people who are not included in the production of published labor force statistics: (1) members of the armed services, and (2) members of the Hispanic oversample who were interviewed in months other than March. WTFINL and EARNWT assign these groups a value of 0. Both groups are assigned non-zero values in ASECWT.

ASECWT is based on the inverse probability of selection into the sample and adjustments for the following factors: failure to obtain an interview; sampling within large sample units; the known distribution of the entire population according to age, sex, and race; over-sampling Hispanic persons; to give husbands and wives the same weight; and an additional step to provide consistency with labor force estimates from the basic survey. 

Estimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.

CPS interviewers collected detailed information about the precise relationships of all persons in the household in their initial listing of household members.  Unfortunately, they then simplified the detailed data (e.g., daughter-in-law, lodger's brother) by coding it into a few broad categories (e.g., "other relative of head," "nonrelative of head with own relatives in household") specified on the interview form.  Only the broad categories are preserved in the data.  The 4-digit codes for RELATE are consistent with the coding scheme used in IPUMS-USA census data.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[SPLOC is a constructed variable that indicates whether the person's spouse lived in the same household and, if so, gives the person number (PERNUM) of the spouse. The method by which probable spouse-spouse links are identified is described in SPRULE.

SPLOC makes it easy for researchers to link the characteristics of (probable) spouses. 

In 2016, the family interrelationship variables for all samples were revised to increase comparability across IPUMS projects and include same-sex couples. Many researchers who are familiar with the previous version of family interrelationship variables will find it useful to read a brief overview of the key differences of the New IPUMS Family Interrelationship Variables [URL omitted from DDI.]. On this page you'll find information on how family interrelationship variables are constructed, common uses of these variables, and specific examples of how these variables can be used efficiently.

The pre-2016 version of SPLOC and other IPUMS pointer variables are available here [URL omitted from DDI.].]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HISPAN identifies and classifies persons of Hispanic/Spanish/Latino origin.  Origin is ancestry, lineage, heritage, national group, or country of birth.   

Prior to 2003, information was collected by asking, "What is the origin or descent of each person in this household?" and asking the respondent to select the appropriate category from a limited number of choices on a flashcard (including "another group not listed.")   The choices included five to eight choices that would be classified as Hispanic, "Negro" and "Black," and a small number of European ancestry groups such as "German."  

The primary intention of the question was to identify Hispanic respondents, rather than origin or descent for the general population.  Beginning in 1976, the original CPS data preserved detail for only the Hispanic responses, with all others answers lumped together as "another group not listed" (relabeled "Not Hispanic" in IPUMS-CPS). 

In 2003 and later years, respondents were asked, "Are you Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino?" rather than the broad query about origin or descent.  Detailed information about Hispanic ethnicity was collected only from those who answered "yes" to this initial question.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HIMCAID indicates whether the respondent was covered by Medicaid during the previous calendar year.  The data in HIMCAID were edited by the Census Bureau and assign Medicaid coverage to some persons who did not report such health insurance during questioning.  For general discussion of Medicaid funding and eligibility, see CAID.
 
For 1980-1987, information on health insurance coverage was collected only for persons age 15 and above.  The CPS interviewer asked, "At any time during [the previous year], was anyone in this household covered by Medicaid, the public assistance program that pays for health care?  Who was that?"   The Census Bureau edited the data to allot coverage (a "yes" response in HIMCAID) to some children, as well as to some categories of adults who did not provide an affirmative response to the Medicaid question.  All children under age 21 in families were assumed to be covered by Medicaid if either the householder or spouse reported being covered by Medicaid.  All adult AFDC recipients and their children, and SSI recipients living in states which legally required Medicaid coverage for persons receiving Supplemental Security Income, were also coded as "yes" in HIMCAID.  

Beginning in 1988, the question wording remained the same, but CPS interviewers directly collected information on Medicaid coverage for all household members, of all ages.   With the introduction of computer-assisted interviewing technology (CATI) in 1994, the interviewer also asked about Medicaid coverage by referring to the state-specific names of Medicaid programs in the state where the household was located.  

After 1987, the Census Bureau continued to edit the data in HIMCAID, assigning Medicaid coverage to some persons who did not mention Medicaid during questioning.  For example, in 1996 and 1997, HIMCAID was coded as "Yes" if the individual reported coverage from Indian Health Service, or reported having "other government health care" or "other insurance" in a final, follow-up question about health insurance not previously acknowledged.]]></txt>

For 1980-1987, information on health insurance coverage was collected only for persons age 15 and above.  The CPS interviewer asked, "At any time during [the previous year], was anyone in this household covered by Medicare, the health insurance for persons 65 years old and over or persons with disabilities?"   The Census Bureau edited the data to allot coverage (a "Yes" response in HIMCARE) to all persons age 65 and older who reported income from Social Security.  After 1988, the universe for Medicare recipients was still treated as persons age 15 and older, even though the survey generally focused on insurance coverage for all age groups.  

Beginning in 1988, the question wording remained the same, but CPS interviewers directly collected information on insurance coverage for all household members, of all ages.   Because the universe for Medicare coverage was treated as persons age 15 and older, this basic change in the phrasing of insurance-related questions had less effect on HIMCARE than on other insurance-related variables.]]></txt>

For 1980-1987, information on military health insurance coverage was collected only on persons age 15 and above.  The CPS interviewer asked, "At any time during [the previous year], was anyone in this household covered by CHAMPUS, VA, or military health care?  Who was that?"   Editing by the Census Bureau allotted coverage (a "yes" response in HICHAMP) to the child and adult dependents (e.g., children, spouse) covered by the policy of the household member enrolled in CHAMPUS or other military health care.      

For 1988-1993, the question wording remained the same, but CPS interviewers directly collected information on military health insurance coverage for all household members, of all ages. With the introduction of computer-assisted interviewing technology (CATI) in 1994, information was collected through a series of questions, after the interviewer had asked about employment-based and privately-purchased insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare.  Specifically, the interviewer asked, "At any time during [the previous calendar year], was anyone in the household covered by any other kind of health insurance, including CHAMPUS, CHAMPVA, VA or military health care, or the Indian Health Service?  Who was that?  What plan were you covered by?"  Those who reported coverage by CHAMPUS, CHAMPVA, or VA health care were coded as "yes" in HICHAMP.]]></txt>

The term "covered by private insurance" in the direct question posed to respondents is ambiguous; coverage might mean either being a private insurance policyholder or having coverage as a dependent via someone else's private insurance policy.  Because some respondents interpreted the question in the former, narrower sense, the identification of persons covered by private insurance (either as policyholders or as dependents) via the Bureau's allocation program in COVERPI is more complete than the private health insurance coverage reported in PHINSUR.]]></txt>

The interviewer asked whether, at any time during the previous calendar year, anyone in the household was covered by a health plan provided through a current or former employer or union (excluding military health insurance), and distinguished between policyholders and dependents covered by the plan through follow-up questions.     

Persons who were policyholders for such insurance are identified in the GRPOWNLY variable. Up to two household members who were policyholders for employment-based group health insurance are identified in the GRPWHO1 and GRPWHO2 variables. Using the GRPWHO1, GRPWHO2, and LINENO variables, researchers can identify the policyholder(s) whose employment-based insurance provided coverage for someone coded as "Yes" in GRPDEPLY.  

Through programming in IPUMS-CPS, other cases were added to the pool of positive responses for GRPDEPLY in 1996-2018.

TRICARE was formerly known as the Civilian Health and Medical Program Uniform Service of the Department of Defense, or CHAMPUS. CHAMPUS was a health care benefits program that provides in-patient and out-patient care from civilian sources and Military Treatment Facilities on a cost sharing basis.  In the late 1990s, a managed care approach was phased in, under the name TRICARE. Retired members of the military are eligible for such coverage, as are the dependents of active-duty, retired, and deceased military.
