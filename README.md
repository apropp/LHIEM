## Description

LHIEM was designed to assess a health care financing proposal that would allow individuals to borrow from the U.S. government to cover health care costs, requiring careful tracking of medical expenditures and medical debt over time. However, LHIEM is flexible enough to be used for a range of modeling needs related to predicting health care spending and income over time. The paper linked above describes the model and all dynamic modules in depth, and includes a case study to demonstrate how LHIEM can be used to evaluate proposed policy changes.
