	Abstract = {This article uses a demographic approach and data from the Health and Retirement Survey, a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population, to investigate sex differences in the length of life lived with heart disease and after a heart attack for persons in the United States age 50 and older. On average, women live longer than men with heart disease. At age 50 women can expect to live 7.9 years and men 6.7 years with heart disease. The average woman experiences heart disease onset three years older and heart attacks 4.4 years older than men.},

	Abstract = {In the United States, one-quarter of Medicare spending occurs in the last 12 months of life, which is commonly seen as evidence of waste. Einav et al. used predictive modeling to reassess this interpretation. From detailed Medicare claims data, the extent to which spending is concentrated not just on those who die, but on those who are expected to die, can be estimated. Most deaths are unpredictable; hence, focusing on end-of-life spending does not necessarily identify {\textquotedblleft}wasteful{\textquotedblright} spending.Science, this issue p. 1462That one-quarter of Medicare spending in the United States occurs in the last year of life is commonly interpreted as waste. But this interpretation presumes knowledge of who will die and when. Here we analyze how spending is distributed by predicted mortality, based on a machine-learning model of annual mortality risk built using Medicare claims. Death is highly unpredictable. Less than 5\% of spending is accounted for by individuals with predicted mortality above 50\%. The simple fact that we spend more on the sick{\textemdash}both on those who recover and those who die{\textemdash}accounts for 30 to 50\% of the concentration of spending on the dead. Our results suggest that spending on the ex post dead does not necessarily mean that we spend on the ex ante {\textquotedblleft}hopeless.{\textquotedblright}},

@article{Narayan2003,
	Abstract = {{ContextAlthough diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent and costly chronic
diseases in the United States, no estimates have been published of individuals'
average lifetime risk of developing diabetes.ObjectiveTo estimate age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-specific lifetime risk of
diabetes in the cohort born in 2000 in the United States.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsData from the National Health Interview Survey (1984-2000) were used
to estimate age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-specific prevalence and incidence
in 2000. US Census Bureau data and data from a previous study of diabetes
as a cause of death were used to estimate age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-specific
mortality rates for diabetic and nondiabetic populations.Main Outcome MeasuresResidual (remaining) lifetime risk of diabetes (from birth to 80 years
in 1-year intervals), duration with diabetes, and life-years and quality-adjusted
life-years lost from diabetes.ResultsThe estimated lifetime risk of developing diabetes for individuals born
in 2000 is 32.8\\% for males and 38.5\\% for females. Females have higher residual
lifetime risks at all ages. The highest estimated lifetime risk for diabetes
is among Hispanics (males, 45.4\\% and females, 52.5\\%). Individuals diagnosed
as having diabetes have large reductions in life expectancy. For example,
we estimate that if an individual is diagnosed at age 40 years, men will lose
11.6 life-years and 18.6 quality-adjusted life-years and women will lose 14.3
life-years and 22.0 quality-adjusted life-years.ConclusionsFor individuals born in the United States in 2000, the lifetime probability
of being diagnosed with diabetes mellitus is substantial. Primary prevention
of diabetes and its complications are important public health priorities.}},
